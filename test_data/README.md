**Notebooks description**
- [Test_mapper.ipynb](Test_mapper.ipynb) — notebook with tests for the mapper based on euclidean distances in the raw feature (ssGSEA&PROGENy) space. Takes classses based on correctly scaled features as ground truth and compares them with classes based on features, scaled for samples with their respective identified batches, for 1000 samples, for different *k* neighbors. For *k*=20 and *k*=100 uses calculated with the same pipeline classes probabilities based on expression values for the comparison.

- [QC_example_notebook.ipynb](QC_example_notebook.ipynb) — notebook with example QC for the prepared dataset [QC_example_SKCM_HugoMAPK2_GSE75313](QC_example_SKCM_HugoMAPK2_GSE75313). Input: 'kallisto_pseudocounts.tsv' file is file generated from kallisto output ('abundance.tsv' file) for correctly built reference; 'kallisto_tpm.tsv' is expression dataframe generated from aggregated pseudocount values; see  [DATA_AND_QC.md](DATA_AND_QC.md) for the instructions on how to get these files. Output: log-scaled expression values without bad samples according to QC (example: [QC_example_SKCM_HugoMAPK2_GSE75313/output/expressions_refined.tsv.gz](QC_example_SKCM_HugoMAPK2_GSE75313/output/expressions_refined.tsv.gz)). Important notes:
 
    - The notebook can be used for all applicable data as described in [DATA_AND_QC.md](DATA_AND_QC.md); for processed RNAseq - after checking that data is in TPM, proceed to the "Expression data QC (RNAseq, Microarrays)" of the notebook; for microarray data - skip "RNAseq-only section" part of the notebook and proceed with  "Expression data QC (RNAseq, Microarrays)" section.
      
    - For RNAseq data, it is also important to check the read quality aside from other metrics. We show here a generated [multiqc report](QC_example_SKCM_HugoMAPK2_GSE75313/multiqc_report.html) as an example.

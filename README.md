# Immune_Escape

In recent years, a number of computational approaches provided different strategies to classify solid tumors based on the specific transcriptomic features of their tumor microenvironment (TME), predicting prognosis or elucidating responders to therapies. Still there is no unifying model that can account for different aspects of immune activity and tumor evasion within the same patient and guide development of novel immunotherapeutics. Tumor immune escape mechanisms, major causes of immunotherapy resistance, were also rarely included and intersected with TME states. In this study, we offered an approach to map a wide spectrum of known tumor IE mechanisms onto a large clinical cohort of cancer patients, harmonizing more than 37,000 patient samples, collected across 193 different datasets. Our findings discerned TME types that match existing approaches and are relevant to the developing TME-targeted therapies. We compared our TME classification framework to existing classifications and demonstrated a broadening method which allowed us to differentiate patients according to potential response to a number of targeted therapies. The proposed framework can be deployed by the medical and scientific community to interpret results of clinical trials, improve drug development and therapy decisions.
